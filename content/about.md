Hi there ðŸ‘‹.

My name is <span style="color: #ee6e73;">Cooper</span> and I like to build things. I've lived in Austin, Texas my entire life and have a wonderful girlfriend who I've been with for the past 10 years. We have a motley crew of animals and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I've always worked for myself in one way or another, and most of my endeavors have involved buying & selling in digital marketplaces or making money off the transactional spread in some market-making capacity. Lately I have realized the importance of a having a team, and I have a strong desire to work with  a passionate group of people to accomplish something bigger than I could by myself.

I love bringing a project from inception to production, be it profit or passion driven. Building something that solves a problem is **addicting and fulfilling**.

Two facets of my personality:

> I tend to listen more than I speak.

> I carry strong opinions that are weakly held.

Thanks for reading,

<span style="color: #ee6e73;">_Cooper_</span>
