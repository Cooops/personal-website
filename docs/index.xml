      <description>‚ÄúI hear I forget. I see I remember. I do I understand.‚Äù
Confucius
 A recurring theme I have noticed ever since delving into the world of programming is just how much noise there is out there, and more so how hard it can be to find the right signal to follow. Naturally, my sample size is not incredibly large, but there seems to be a dichotomy of sorts between those who focus on learning by building projects and those who focus on studying &amp;amp; focusing on grinding websites like HackerRank, CodeWars, LeetCode and more.</description>

      <description>h1, body { color: white; }  Hi there üëã.
My name is Cooper and I like to build things. I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Austin, Texas my entire life and have a wonderful girlfriend who I&amp;rsquo;ve been with for the past 10 years. We have a motley crew of animals and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it any other way.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always worked for myself in one way or another, and most of my endeavors have involved buying &amp;amp; selling in digital marketplaces or making money off the transactional spread in some market-making capacity.</description>

 Hello world :).
The posts I upload to this website are a collection of random thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had, dev related or otherwise.
If you somehow stumbled upon this page, welcome ^^.
